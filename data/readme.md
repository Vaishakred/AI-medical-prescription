Usage
For Healthcare Professionals

Patient Assessment
pythonfrom ai_prescription import PrescriptionAI

# Initialize with healthcare provider credentials
ai = PrescriptionAI(provider_id="HP123456", license_number="MD789012")

# Analyze patient data
patient_data = {
    "age": 45,
    "weight": 70,  # kg
    "allergies": ["penicillin"],
    "current_medications": ["lisinopril 10mg"],
    "symptoms": "chest pain, shortness of breath",
    "vital_signs": {"bp": "140/90", "hr": 85}
}

# Generate prescription recommendations
recommendations = ai.analyze_and_recommend(patient_data)

Prescription Generation
python# Review and generate prescription
prescription = ai.generate_prescription(
    patient_id="P001",
    diagnosis="Hypertension",
    recommendations=recommendations,
    provider_approval=True
)

# Validate prescription
validation = ai.validate_prescription(prescription)
if validation.is_safe:
    prescription.finalize()
